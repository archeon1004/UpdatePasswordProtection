The smart lockout capabilities were confirmed to not protecting this endpoint against password guessing kind of things therefore keeping it enabled might be searious risk to consider for companies. Windows Server 2019 comes with functionallity called  [Risk Assesment Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/development/ad-fs-risk-assessment-model). This example uses SQLite database to store users that failed to provide correct password more than 3 times.
